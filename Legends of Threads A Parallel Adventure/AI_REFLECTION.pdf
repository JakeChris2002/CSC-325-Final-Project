For this project, I used GitHub Copilot to help with writing 

code and setting up the game’s structure. It gave suggestions 

for how to organize the character classes, use threads, and 

manage shared resources safely. Copilot also helped with 

things like locks, atomic variables, and queues, and it offered 

ideas for using Java features like lambdas and streams. I 

checked all the code it suggested, fixed any problems, and 

added my own ideas to make the game work the way I wanted. The 

AI made the work faster and easier, but I reviewed everything 

and made all final decisions myself.
